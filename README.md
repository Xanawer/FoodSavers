# FoodSavers
CyberYouth Hackthon Submission


## Inspiration

Food waste is a significant issue in Singapore, with approximately 817,000 tonnes of food waste generated in 2021. Recognizing the environmental impact and the potential to help those in need, we were inspired to create a solution that could bridge the gap between food donors and recipients, ultimately reducing food waste and fostering a more sustainable community.

## What it does

FoodSavers is a web application that connects food donors (such as restaurants, supermarkets, and individuals) with recipients (including charities, food banks, and individuals in need). The app allows donors to list surplus food items, while recipients can browse and claim available donations. Key features include:

- User-friendly interface for donors to list food items with details like quantity, expiration date, and pickup location
- Search and filter options for recipients to find suitable donations
- Real-time notifications for matched donations
- In-app messaging for coordination between donors and recipients
- Rating system to ensure quality and reliability

## How we built it

We developed FoodSavers using the following technologies:

1. Backend and Frontend: Oracle APEX for rapid application development
2. Database: Oracle Database for robust and scalable data storage
3. Cloud Infrastructure: Oracle Cloud for hosting and scalability
4. UI Design: Figma for creating mockups and prototyping the user interface
5. System Architecture: Miro for creating system diagrams and visualizing the overall application structure
6. Mapping: Integration with mapping services for location-based features

## Challenges we ran into

1. Ensuring food safety and quality control in the donation process
2. Implementing an efficient matching algorithm for donors and recipients
3. Handling time-sensitive donations to prevent spoilage
4. Designing an intuitive user interface for both donors and recipients
5. Complying with local regulations regarding food redistribution
6. Adapting to the Oracle APEX development environment and optimizing performance

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. Developing a functional prototype that addresses a real-world problem
2. Creating an algorithm that efficiently matches donors with suitable recipients
3. Implementing a user-friendly interface that simplifies the donation process
4. Leveraging Oracle APEX to rapidly develop and deploy our application
5. Utilizing Figma to create visually appealing and user-centric designs
6. Receiving positive feedback from initial user testing

## What we learned

1. The complexities of food waste management and redistribution
2. The importance of user experience design in encouraging app adoption
3. The power of low-code platforms like Oracle APEX for rapid prototyping
4. The benefits of cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability
5. The value of visual tools like Figma and Miro in the design and planning process
6. The significance of data privacy and security in handling user information
7. The importance of cross-functional collaboration in addressing multifaceted problems

## What's next for FoodSavers

1. Expanding partnerships with local businesses and charities
2. Implementing a gamification system to incentivize regular donations
3. Enhancing the application with additional Oracle Cloud services
4. Integrating analytics to track impact and optimize the donation process
5. Exploring blockchain technology on Oracle Cloud for enhanced transparency and traceability
6. Collaborating with government agencies to align with and support national food waste reduction initiatives
7. Conducting extensive user testing and iterating on the UI based on feedback
